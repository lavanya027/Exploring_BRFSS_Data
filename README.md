#**EXPLORING THE BRFSS DATA**#

The Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a collaborative project between all of the states in the United States (US) and participating US territories and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam collect data annually and American Samoa, Federated States of Micronesia, and Palau collect survey data over a limited point- in-time (usually one to three months). It is an ongoing surveillance system designed to measure behavioural risk factors for the non-institutionalized adult population (18 years of age and older) residing in the US.

**The main goal of the project is to explore this data and answer some of the socially relevant questions through the information provided.**  

- Research question 1: Is there a correlation between annual income level and number of poor mental health days in a month. And how does it varies with sex?
- Research question 2: Is there a correlation between a personâ€™s general health and how much time a person sleeps. How does that vary with sex?
- Research question 3: Is there a correlation between No of Poor Mental Health days/month and Binge Drinking ?
